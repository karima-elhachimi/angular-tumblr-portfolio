# Yannick's portfolio website

A simple visual portfolio website that uses the Angular CLi as front end and the tumblr Api as a CMS. 


## Want to use this for your own portfolio?
In the src/app/post.service.ts file, edit out the 
tumblr connection property to contain your own api keys and tumblr blog address. 
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
